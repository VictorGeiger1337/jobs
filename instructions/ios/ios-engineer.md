## Calendar and Agenda Views

![](ios_01.png)

Build an iOS app that replicates the basic features described below of the Calendar and Agenda views on the [Outlook iOS (iPhone) app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook-email-calendar/id951937596?mt=8).

We've highlighted the primary features of each of these views below. You can decide which other details to implement and any new features you can come up with.

### Calendar View

![](ios_02.png)

The calendar view is a freely scrolling view that allows the user to browse between days of the year. Tapping on a date should update the information displayed in the Agenda view.

### Agenda View

The agenda view is a freely scrolling view that allows the user to browse events in chronological order. Moving between dates should update the information displayed in the Calendar view.

### Other Tips

- Make sure the expansion and contraction interaction between the Calendar View and Agenda View is fast and fluid

- Use of open source dependencies is allowed but they are not necessary to complete the challenge

- Use a static data set for your events

## Bonus: Networking Challenge

Integrate an internet data source to retrieve the weather forecast for the user's device location. Display that information wherever you think makes the most sense.

Here are some weather data providers: [Forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/), [Wunderground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/), and [Yahoo](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/)
